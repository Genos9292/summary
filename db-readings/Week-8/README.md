* [Reflections on Trusting Trust](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rxin/db-papers/TrustingTrust-Thompson.pdf) (1984): Ken Thompson's Turing Award acceptance speech in 1984, describing black box backdoor issues and pointing out trust is not absolute.

* [What Goes Around Comes Around](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~yanlei/courses/CS691LL-f06/papers/SH05.pdf): Michael Stonebraker and Joseph M. Hellerstein provide a summary of 35 years of data model proposals, grouped into 9 different eras. The paper discusses the proposals of each era, and show that there are only a few basic data modeling ideas, and most have been around a long time. Later proposals inevitably bear a strong resemblance to certain earlier proposals.
