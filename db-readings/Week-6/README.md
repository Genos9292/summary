## <a name='data-parallel'> Data-Parallel Computation

* [MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html) (2004): MapReduce is both a programming model (borrowed from an old concept in functional programming) and a system at Google for distributed data-intensive computation. The programming model is so simple yet expressive enough to capture a wide range of programming needs. The system, coupled with the model, is fault-tolerant and scalable. It is probably fair to say that half of the academia are now working on problems heavily influenced by MapReduce.

* [Resilient Distributed Datasets: A Fault-Tolerant Abstraction for In-Memory Cluster Computing](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rxin/db-papers/Spark.pdf) (2012): This is the research paper behind the Spark cluster computing project at Berkeley. Spark exposes a distributed memory abstraction called RDD, which is an immutable collection of records distributed across a cluster's memory. RDDs can be transformed using MapReduce style computations. The RDD abstraction can be orders of magnitude more efficient for workloads that exhibit strong temporal locality, e.g. query processing and iterative machine learning. Spark is an example of why it is important to separate the MapReduce programming model from its execution engine.

* [Shark: SQL and Rich Analytics at Scale](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/publication/shark-sql-and-rich-analytics-at-scale/) (2013): Describes the Shark system, which is the SQL engine built on top of Spark. More importantly, the paper discusses why previous SQL on Hadoop/MapReduce query engines were slow.

* [Spanner](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf) (2012): Spanner is "a scalable, multi-version, globally distributed, and synchronously replicated database". The linchpin that allows all this functionality is the TrueTime API which lets Spanner order events between nodes without having them communicate. [There is some speculation that the TrueTime API is very similar to a vector clock but each node has to store less data](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~demirbas/publications/augmentedTime.pdf). Sadly, a paper on TrueTime is promised, but hasn't yet been released.
