 ### Yann LeCun1,2, Yoshua Bengio3 & Geoffrey Hinton4 - 28 MAY 2015
 
* This is papers mainly outlines the survey on deep learning techniques and thier applications.
* Initially auther discusses about the significance and applications of machine learnig state-of-the-art in speech recognition,visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics.
* Later author discusses about limitations of conventional machine learning techniques and deep learning as a solution.
* explaination of deep learning methods of representaion-learning.
* Deep learning is making major advances in solving problems that
have resisted the best attempts of the artificial intelligence community
for many years.
* It has turned out to be very good at discovering
intricate structures in high-dimensional data and is therefore applicable
to many domains of science, business and government.
* In addition to beating records in image recognition1–4 and speech recognition5–7, it has beaten other machine-learning techniques at predicting the activity of potential drug molecules8, analysing particle accelerator data9,10,reconstructing brain circuits11, and predicting the effects of mutations in non-coding DNA on gene expression and disease. 
* Perhaps more surprisingly, deep learning has produced extremely promising results for various tasks in natural language understanding14, particularly
topic classification, sentiment analysis, question answering15 and language
translation.

* review on most common form of machine learning technique - supervised learning
* review on Backpropagation to train multilayer architectures 
* review on Convolutional neural networks
* review on Image understanding with deep convolutional networks 
* review on Distributed representations and language processing 
* review on Recurrent neural networks 
* review on future of deep learning
