## <a name='dht'> Distributed Hash Tables
* [Experiences with CoralCDN: A Five-Year Operational View](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mfreed/docs/coral-nsdi10.pdf) (2010): CoralCDN provides an open (and free!) web content distributuion network (CDN) that anyone can use simply by appending .nyud.net to any URL. This paper presents lessons from a 5-year deployment of CoralCDN, one of the largest/longest real-world deployments of a DHT-based system. Paper presents challenges they faced and solutions that worked, along with lessons for building open systems.
* [Beehive: O(1) Lookup Performance for Power-Law Query Distributions in Peer-to-Peer Overlays](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/papers/beehive.pdf) (2004): Beehive encourages looking at usage/query patterns of your target application and then optimizing caching in the DHT accordingly. DNS lookups (their target application) for example have a power-law query distribution and proactive replication can help a lot for performance in that case.

## <a name='storage'> Storage Systems
* [Separating key management from file system security](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/sfs:sosp99.pdf) (1999): This paper presents SFS (secure file system) that uses self-certifying names. SFS is motivated to have a global file system where key-management is handled outside of the file system. Self-certifying names, presented in an [earlier paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.43.8989&rep=rep1&type=pdf), are a key contribution and they're used by modern storage systems like [IPFS](http://ipfs.io). 
* [Efficient Replica Maintenance for Distributed Storage Systems](http://oceanstore.cs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/pdf/carbonite06.pdf) (2006): This paper looks at replication strategies for distributed storage systems and tradeoff between false positives and rereplication costs, particularly in trying to accurately differentiate between nodes which have temporarily lost connectivity and those which are more permanently offline.
* [Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf) (2007): Dynamo is Amazon's production key/value store that makes a tradeoff between consistency for availability and performance and uses eventual consistency. Amazon actually controls all nodes where DynamoDB is deployed, trying to build a similar system under decentralization requirements is much harder.
* [Wide-area cooperative storage with CFS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/cfs:sosp01/cfs_sosp.pdf) (2001): CFS is a P2P read-only storage system that uses Chord for DHT-routing and SFS for storage. CFS introduces a per-IP quota for limiting amount of data written by a single attacker.
* [Tahoe – The Least-Authority Filesystem](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/524.pdf) (2008): Tahoe-LAFS is an [open-source](https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs) file store that takes many ideas from theory, like principle of least authority and Reed-Solomon codes etc., to build a practical storage system that is commercially used.
